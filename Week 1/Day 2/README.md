Reflect: How do I feel about the first webpage? Body! It's bland and boring, but
will clearly be the cornerstone from which we start working. I'm just glad
I know how to make it on my own without assistance. What was the most difficult
aspect of creating the html page? Apparently it was simple spelling errors.
I was able to work my way backwards and find all the steps but I was stopped
dead completely by two simple spelling mistakes. What, if anythihng, do I
still have questions about? When do we begin getting to edit HTML so I can
make some webpages to show off to friends and family. Review: What is the
DOCTYPE? Determines the type of document, such as HTML, etc. What is the
difference between the <head> and the <body>? Only guessing, but I'm assuming
the head has to deal with the heading of the actual webpage, as in the name
that appears in the bar at the top (not the address, but the "title" of the
page), and the body is everything that appears on the page itself. The little
oh HTML I have experience with, we edited the background colors etc in the
body.
