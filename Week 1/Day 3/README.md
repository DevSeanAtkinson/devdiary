Reflect: What is the best thing about this class so far? The best thing as of
now is that now we're in HTML and given a bunch of toys to play with, now I
have something to play with over the weekend. What would happen if you made
a an <h7> tag in a web page? It apparently doesn't do anything. The tags
 obviously didn't show up, but the text appeared as normal text. 
How would you describe an html page to a middle
school kid? It's what makes Neopets run. Review: Describe each of the following
 tags. h1: Biggest header. h3: 3rd largest header. li: List item, place them
within lists. ul: Unordered list. ol: Orderest list, aka numbered list.
span: ??? Sounds like it allows you to copy other tasks and repeat them? Maybe?
 div: ??? I have no idea. em: Emphasis... EMPHASIS! But it's secretly just
 italics. strong: BOLD. p: Paragraph, the basic bodies of information.
