Reflect: What else would you like to be able to do when creating your web
applications?
I would like to know how to make my webpages more styalized. The current
set of tools looks really cartoonish and not very professional.

How do you think you are going to keep the different languages
JavaScript, CSS, and HTML straight?
I honestly don't understand the difference very well, they mostly seem to
blend, which I sort of thought was the goal, but judging by this question,
it seems more important to identify them... HTML I know well enough from
expiramenting around with it, JavaScript I believe is mostly just the hardware
commands the computer recognizes as making the functions happen more so than
HTML's style commands and CSS seems to be for formatting parts of a page.

Review: Answer the following questions:
1. How would you select a paragraph and make the text "light-salmon"?
I would use a paragraph tag under the style tag at the top of the page,
and would add in,

 p {
   color: light-salmon
 }

2. What is the difference between inline and
  internal styles?
Inline styles uses the style code next to the part of the page you want to change,
where as internal styles is added at the style tag at the top of the page,
and affects everything within it's appropriate field.

3. What will the following CSS styling do?
  h1 {
    font family: "Comic Sans MS";
    background-color: chartreuse;
  }

That will change the h1 tagged text to change the font to Comic Sans (professional)
and will change the background of the TEXT, but not the whole page, into a
chartreuse green (also very professional).
