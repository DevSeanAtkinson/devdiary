Reflect:
1. What was the most frustrating thing about today?
Having to unplug my computer two times so I could style all over
Justin's code of errors.

2. Why do you think that good code conventions are in place?
To give a consistent flow for ease of reading by other programmers. If
everyone just used their own style would make reading by other people very
 difficult.

3. How would you describe the box model to someone that has never seen a
computer?
It's a series of text organized by function and use.

Review:
1. List all of the errors that you found today?
A capital O instead of a 0 in the hex code, brackets left open with no closing
 bracket, mis-spelled words, etc.

2. How would you make sure that you do not suffer through what we did today?
Who suffered? I styled all over that code. But seriously, organizing your
code in box format so it's clear and formatted can make proof-reading for
errors much easier as well as putting a second pair of eyes on the page also
can make things easier.

3. What is padding?
Padding is the buffer between text and the margin.

4. What is margin?
Margin is the distance between the padding and the border.

5. What does the following do?
  a:hover {
    background-color: #FFF;
  }
It changes the color of the links on the page.
