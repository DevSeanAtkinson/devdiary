Reflect:
Could you make a simple website utilizing what we have learned thus far? Why or
 why not? I could make a VERY simple website. I still don't know how to host it
  or load it anywhere other than my personal computer, but I can make a basic
  website with basic text and images. What do you feel is the most difficult
  to understand about git and the git workflow? I have the order down now,
   it's just a matter of REMEMBERING to be constantly committing to git and
   doing it frequently. What is the most interesting thing that you have learned
    thus far? The most interesting was just getting to toy around in HTML,
    I would really like to make a basic website over the weekend just to get
    better acquantied (SP?) with all my options.

    Review:

  Describe the gitworkflow up until this point. Be specific about the order and
   the reason. First you git init to make the files git files. Then you need to
    git add so git knows which files to watch for changes. Then you need to be
    git committing in frequently in order to have multiple save states of files
    in order to find where an error happens when things inevitably break. Last
    is the git push, which is what pushes your work to github so that you and
    other users can access the code. What is the difference between <ul> and
    <ol>? <ul> is an unordered list, which will list the information in bullets,
     <ol> is an orderd list, which translates into numbered lists. What does
     the <a> allow you to do with a webpage? It's an anchor, useful for making
     links to other webpages.
