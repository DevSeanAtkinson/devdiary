Reflect:

1. You have learned three different languages up until this point,
which one is the easiest to you, HTML, CSS, or Javascript? Why?

- HTML has been the easiest for me mostly because that's the one that I had
the most experience with going into this class. HTML is the one where I
feel like I understand what's happening when I write the code rather than
a rough understanding.

2. We have just touched on HTML, CSS and Javascript, what was the most
difficult concept of those three to you?

- JavaScript, HTML was the easiest, and CSS feels like it's meant to work
in tandem with HTML. JavaScript feels the most mechanical out of all of them
and I'm having the hardest time grasping.

3. What is a site that you could build with your skills up until this point?

- If I had someone to do the art assets I'm pretty sure I could build all of
Neopets with my firm grasp on HTML. I could also make a flippin' sweet
Myspace page (Tom is my number one friend for life dawg!)

Review:

1. I need to grab a buton, with the id "clicky" and the classes
'btn btn-default', to change the styling when the button is clicked.
Which one of the JavaScript selector functions would you use?

- You would use the "id" tag because it's specific to just the one button,
as opposed to the class which could be multiple buttons.

2. What are some of the events that you can 'listen' for and respond
to with the DOM elements?

- onclick, mousedown, mouseup, keydown, keyup, etc, etc.

3. What is provided to you when you use the getElementByld? How is this
different than the getElementByClass?

- Get ID will return information about the selected value. Get Class
wil return information on all of the items with the attributed class.
