Reflect:

1. What do you think about the code-along procedure of the class? What would
be the alternative if you do not?

- I like coding along, my biggest fear with this class was missing one point
and being lost forever, but coding along has made it pretty easy for me to
keep up in the class. I don't have an alternative, I like the class structure.

2. What is your greatest obstacle to creating a web application at this point?

- Speed, I feel like I can do most of the formatting for any type of website,
I just know that it would take me a long amount of time to painfully work
through all the details until it was satisfactory. 

3. What is one thing that you could do to get better with JavaScript?

- W3 schools has a few coding forms on their site to help ease people into
coding with JavaScript.

Review:

1. What does the word 'var' mean and how do you use it?

- Var means variable, it acts as the name for your functions within JavaScript.

2. What does the following line of code do? (Be specific).

var aThing = [1, 'two', false];

- It creates an array where item zero = 1, item two = two, and item two = false.
The name of the array is "aThing".

3. What are the datatypes for the following:

true
'true'
3
{1: 'one', 2: 'two'}

- From top to bottom, boolean, string, number, object
