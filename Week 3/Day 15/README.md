Reflect:

1. This class can be difficult at times, how does it compare to the things
that you have done before?

- My experience with learning new things is I don't generally start to
understand until I actually do them, so I feel like I've been keeping up
so well because we're constantly having to type out the code and execute
the assignments as we do them, instead of trying not to fall asleep while
someone rambles on at the front of the class (I didn't do well in
school.)

2. We all have our own ideas and ways that we prefer to accomplish tasks, how
do you think that people would fair if the class was run the way you prefer?

- I usually want to move at a faster pace, I feel like I understand the
concepts quicker than the rest, but that clearly doesn't work in
everyone's best interests (not to mention I've had my fair share of moments
where I don't grasp something as quickly as everyone else, the last lesson
of today being a good example, and I appreciate the chance to take it slow
same as everyone else.)

Review:

1. Describe, in words not code, how you would accomplish each of the following:

    1. Add a mouse enter event handler to every anchor tag on the page that
    changes the text size.

    - I would create a series of variables that would lead to a function
    so that when you hit the enter button it would change the internal
    styles at the top of the page to scale down through a string.

    2. Add a user login page to your website so that people only see the pages
    you want them to see.

    - I would add a input section that then links to a directory of the pages
    for my site after they sign in with their information (not very secure,
    but hey, its the tools I have).

    3. Position an image in the center of the page.

    - I would post my image using the image tag and then add change the
    alignments to 50% so that it would be dead center of the screen.
